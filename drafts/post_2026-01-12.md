𝗘𝗗𝗜 𝟴𝟱𝟲 latency kills cross-docking efficiency.

If your shipping notice arrives after the physical trailer, your warehouse is flying blind. This isn't just a communication lag; it’s a labor cost multiplier.

In high-velocity environments, relying on legacy batch processing for an 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 leads to 'ghost inventory' and massive receiving bottlenecks. The solution isn't just faster EDI; it's a hybrid architecture.

* Map your EDI 856 to include mandatory 𝗟𝗣𝗡 (License Plate Number) data at the carton level.
* Use 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀 for real-time 'truck dispatched' status updates to prep the labor force.
* Preserve the EDI document for the financial record, but let the API trigger the 𝗪𝗠𝗦 staging logic.

Don't let legacy protocols dictate your dock-to-stock speed. Tighten the handshake between your 𝗘𝗥𝗣 and your fulfillment partner’s system. Integration is only as good as its timing.

How are you handling the data gap between physical departure and digital transmission?
