Stop relying on simple timestamps for ERP inventory updates. 

In high-scale WMS-to-ERP integrations, asynchronous 945 messages often arrive out of order or concurrently. If your middleware blindly pushes updates, you will face 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 failures or "dirty reads" that corrupt your Available to Promise (ATP) counts. 

NetSuite and SAP are notorious for record-locking bottlenecks when multiple threads hit the same Item record simultaneously. A "last-in-wins" approach is a recipe for phantom stock-outs.

My current blueprint for resolving this:
- Implement 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗗𝘀 at the WMS level to ensure 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 across retries.
- Use a 𝗦𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲 (like AWS SQS FIFO) with a partition key mapped to the SKU/Location pair to prevent race conditions.
- Shift to an 𝗔𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 pattern rather than absolute value overwrites to maintain state integrity during high-concurrency peaks.

This ensures that even if a message is re-delivered or delayed, the ERP state remains consistent and the database avoids deadlock scenarios during peak seasonal volume.

How are you handling the trade-off between real-time sync and record locking overhead in your enterprise stack?
