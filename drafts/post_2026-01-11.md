Your ASRS is a brick if your shuttle sequencing depends on 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴.

Most "out-of-the-box" WCS implementations handle basic collision avoidance, but they choke on 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 when multi-tier shuttles compete for a single vertical lift. You end up with forty shuttles waiting for a lift that’s stuck in a circular dependency because your buffer logic assumes linear flow.

The fix isn't adding more sensors; it’s refining the logic. Implement 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗔𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗰 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵 (𝗗𝗔𝗚) mapping for real-time pathfinding instead of static priority flags. Move to 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 via gRPC or high-frequency MQTT to slash the latency between the WCS and the PLC layer.

If your PLC handshake takes more than 50ms, you aren't running an automated system—you’re managing a very expensive traffic jam. Hardware speed is irrelevant if your software overhead creates physical starvation at the lift interface. 

At what latency threshold does your 𝗔𝗦𝗥𝗦 shuttle fleet start creating phantom bottlenecks?
