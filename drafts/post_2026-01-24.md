Traditional ESBs often struggle with the sheer volume and varied nature of logistics event streams from WMS, OMS, and ERPs.

We're increasingly seeing 𝗞𝗮𝗳𝗸𝗮 emerge as a resilient, scalable backbone for these critical data flows. It handles high-throughput, low-latency requirements far better for *event sourcing* and distributed state. This is especially true for global operations needing immutable transaction logs.

Consider a hybrid approach. Use Kafka for real-time event distribution (inventory changes, order status updates, shipment tracking), then leverage a lighter-weight integration platform for transformation and routing to legacy systems or specific API endpoints. Focus on robust 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗲𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 and 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗱-𝗹𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲 strategies.

For those managing large-scale supply chain integrations, where do you see the greatest value in streaming platforms vs. traditional integration middleware today?
