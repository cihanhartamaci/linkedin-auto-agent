Scaling supply chain integration demands moving beyond brittle point-to-point connections. An 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗺𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 architecture offers a significantly more robust and scalable model for WMS, OMS, and ERP systems.

Traditional synchronous API calls or batch ETL often bottleneck under high transaction volumes between systems like NetSuite/SAP, a WMS, and an OMS. An event-driven approach ensures services are decoupled, promoting resilience and horizontal scalability. When a critical action occurs – a `ShipmentConfirmed` event from the WMS, for example – it propagates instantly via an event broker. The OMS or ERP can then react asynchronously, preventing system dependencies and synchronous latency.

Implement a central 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗿 (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis) for all critical supply chain events. Define and enforce strict 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀 (e.g., Avro, Protobuf) for these events using a schema registry. Design consumer services to process events asynchronously and handle potential duplicates gracefully through robust, re-runnable business logic. This pattern radically reduces direct system coupling, boosts throughput, and simplifies system evolution.

What's been your biggest architectural win or challenge moving supply chain integration towards an event-driven model?
