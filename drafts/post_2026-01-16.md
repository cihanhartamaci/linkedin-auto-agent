ERP deadlocks during high-volume WMS fulfillment syncs aren't a load problem; they're an orchestration failure.

When your WMS fires a 𝟵𝟰𝟱 𝗪𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 while the ERP is still locking the Sales Order for a credit check or pre-allocation update, you hit a 409 conflict or a database timeout. Standard linear retries often compound the lock queue, leading to a system-wide hang.

The fix isn't more CPU; it's a smarter state machine.

- Implement a 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗮𝗴𝗮 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 to manage multi-stage transactions across your middleware.
- Use a 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿 with exponential backoff specifically keyed to the Order ID to prevent re-entry collisions.
- Execute a pre-flight 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 via API before pushing the EDI payload to ensure the ERP record is in a 'Commit-Ready' state.
- Decouple the physical inventory decrement from the financial invoice trigger to reduce transaction lock time.

By treating the 945 as a state transition rather than a simple data push, you eliminate the race conditions that plague high-velocity distribution centers.

How are you handling 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 and concurrency when your WMS throughput exceeds your ERP’s API limits during peak season?
