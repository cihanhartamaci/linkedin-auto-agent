Bidirectional data consistency between modern WMS/OMS and legacy ERPs like SAP ECC or NetSuite isn't about mere data transfer; it's a constant reconciliation challenge.

The inherent statefulness and eventual consistency models in logistics mean direct synchronous updates often fail. Systems become authoritative for different data subsets over time. For example, WMS owns inventory location, but ERP owns financial valuation. Changes in one must be accurately reflected, but not overwritten, in the other. This demands robust architectural patterns beyond basic CRUD.

Implement a 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲-𝗼𝗳-𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 for each data attribute. Utilize 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘁𝗮-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 coupled with 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀 on the target system. For complex state transitions (e.g., order fulfillment status), consider command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) at the integration layer. Focus on robust logging and a 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗱𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 to proactively identify and resolve discrepancies.

What architectural patterns have you found most effective for managing bidirectional state reconciliation with legacy ERPs at scale, especially concerning non-atomic updates?
