Master data sync isn't just about moving SKUs; it's about translating complex business rules across disparate systems. Product hierarchies, vendor specifics, or location attributes often get truncated or misinterpreted when moving from ERP (NetSuite, SAP) to WMS/OMS via flat files or basic APIs. This leads to fulfillment errors, incorrect inventory segmentation, and reconciliation nightmares.

Implement a 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 early. Focus on defining a canonical data model for critical entities (e.g., 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁, 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿) that all systems can map to. Use integration platforms for schema enforcement and attribute-level validation. Prioritize versioning for master data changes, ensuring older versions are auditable and reversible.

The cost of bad master data is exponential. How do you manage multi-system product attribute lifecycle without resorting to constant manual data cleansing?
