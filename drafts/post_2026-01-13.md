EDI 856 (ASN) data is often treated as a passive notification. In high-velocity fulfillment, that’s a mistake that leads to 𝗴𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆.

The gap between receiving an ASN and the physical arrival of a trailer creates a "false positive" in stock availability. If your web store pulls directly from WMS inventory totals without filtering for 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲𝘀, you’re selling stock that’s still on a highway 200 miles away.

The fix isn't just "better EDI." It's rigorous status mapping:

* Map incoming 856 data to a 𝗡𝗼𝗻-𝗣𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.
* Use the 𝗦𝗦𝗖𝗖-𝟭𝟴 𝗯𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 as the unique identifier for the entire lifecycle.
* Set a hard trigger: Inventory only flips to "Available" once the 𝗪𝗠𝗦 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗔𝗿𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗹 transaction is time-stamped.

Relying on "Expected Delivery Date" for inventory availability is a recipe for backorders. You need a physical handshake at the dock door to validate the digital record.

Are you using ASNs to automate 𝗖𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀-𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀, or is it still just an electronic packing list for your team?
