𝗥𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 between real-time WMS APIs and batch EDI 846 feeds are a primary cause of ERP inventory drift in high-scale architectures.

When a WMS pushes a real-time shipment confirmation via API, but the legacy EDI 846 (Inventory Advice) arrives shortly after with a stale balance, you risk 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 or record contention. If your ERP—like SAP or NetSuite—uses strict row-level locking during transaction processing, these overlapping updates trigger frequent deadlocks.

To maintain a "single source of truth" without sacrificing performance, consider these three strategies:

* Implement a 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 in your middleware to track the "Last Update Timestamp" per SKU/Location. Reject any EDI payload that is older than the last API-driven update.
* Use 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘀 tied to the WMS 'Wave ID' or 'Transaction ID' to ensure the ERP doesn't process the same inventory deduction twice during a retry loop.
* Deploy a 𝗦𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 pattern at the middleware layer (MuleSoft, Boomi, or Azure Integration Services) to force-order updates for the same Item ID, preventing the "stale-over-fresh" data collision.

Relying on "eventual consistency" is a gamble when dealing with high-velocity fulfillment. Your middleware must be intelligent enough to know which source of truth is the most current at any microsecond.

How are you handling the logic conflict when your real-time API tells one story and your 3PL’s legacy EDI batch tells another?
