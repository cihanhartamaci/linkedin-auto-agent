Achieving true real-time inventory sync at enterprise scale means battling data staleness, not just latency. Propagating inventory changes across WMS, OMS, and ERP (NetSuite/SAP) introduces race conditions and eventual consistency challenges. A simple delta pull isn't enough when hundreds of orders/second hit the OMS while WMS processes shipments.

Implement an 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 using a robust message queue (e.g., Kafka, SQS). WMS publishes inventory updates as events. OMS subscribes for allocation. ERP consumes for financial reconciliation. Crucially, design for optimistic concurrency and use an 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗸𝗲𝘆 for each inventory transaction. Prioritize 'available-to-sell' (𝗔𝗧𝗦) over 'on-hand' for order commitments. Consider a dedicated, lightweight inventory microservice for high-volume reads.

What are your strategies for maintaining sub-second inventory accuracy across diverse systems without deadlocks?
