Inventory drift in high-scale WMS-to-ERP integrations isn’t usually a logic error; it’s a 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 problem.

When pushing 5,000+ Ship Confirmations (945s) per hour alongside real-time Cycle Counts (947s), standard API updates often trigger 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. If your ERP (NetSuite or SAP) locks the Item record for cost recalculations, your inventory sync either fails or creates a massive processing bottleneck.

To solve this at scale, move away from absolute stock overrides. Use a 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝘁𝗮-𝗢𝗻𝗹𝘆 update pattern. This ensures that parallel transactions—like a sale and a warehouse adjustment—don't overwrite each other.

Technical specs for high-volume sync:
• Implement a 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗞𝗲𝘆 in your middleware (MuleSoft, Boomi, or custom).
• Enforce a 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 based on the WMS event timestamp, not the message receipt time.
• Use asynchronous queues with a dedicated "retry-with-exponential-backoff" specifically for database lock errors.

By decoupling the physical event from the ERP commitment, you maintain a sub-second source of truth without crashing your financial system of record.

How are you handling the trade-off between real-time visibility and database lock waits during peak promotional surges?
