Hitting API call limits on NetSuite or SAP is a silent killer for high-volume WMS/OMS integrations. It's not if, but when your integration throughput overwhelms your ERP's governor limits.

This isn't merely an "error" to catch; it's an architectural challenge. Consistent throttling leads to data lag, system backlogs, and ultimately, operational paralysis. Ignoring this means inconsistent inventory, delayed orders, and frustrated teams. It impacts real-time decision-making and operational integrity.

Effective strategies require more than basic retry logic. Consider implementing:
*   𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: Adjust active API calls based on observed success rates and remaining limits.
*   𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲𝘀: Process critical updates (e.g., immediate stock adjustments) ahead of less urgent data.
*   𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗯𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴: Aggregate updates where possible, but be wary of large requests hitting other ERP limits.
*   𝗖𝗶𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: Temporarily halt calls to an exhausted endpoint to prevent cascading failures.
*   𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗷𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿: For retries, critical for preventing stampeding herds on the ERP.

How do you architect around these pervasive ERP rate limits in your most demanding logistics environments?
