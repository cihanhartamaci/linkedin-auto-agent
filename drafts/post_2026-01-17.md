EDI 945 Ship Advices are often too slow to maintain inventory integrity in high-scale OMS architectures.

When your WMS ships a pallet, the legacy 945 batch might lag by 30-60 minutes. During peak volume, this delay creates "ghost inventory" where items are physically gone but still show as 𝗔𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 in the ERP. This lag prevents your 𝗔𝘃𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗲 (𝗔𝗧𝗣) logic from surfacing remaining stock to the storefront.

Stop relying solely on the EDI loop for real-time inventory synchronization. Move to a hybrid model:

1. Trigger a real-time 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜 webhook from the WMS the moment the "Close Trailer" or "Manifest" event occurs.
2. This signal must immediately update the OMS virtual inventory pool, bypassing the ERP’s slower batch processing queue.
3. Treat the 945 as the financial system of record for 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲-𝗪𝗮𝘆 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 and GL reconciliation only.
4. Implement strict 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 at the middleware layer to ensure the 945 doesn't re-trigger inventory deductions already executed by the API signal.

This decouples physical fulfillment from financial reconciliation, ensuring your storefront reflects reality in sub-seconds, not minutes.

How are you handling the delta between physical shipment and ERP state updates in your high-volume flows?
