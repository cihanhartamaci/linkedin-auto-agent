Ensuring data consistency when a single business process spans WMS, OMS, and ERP (e.g., NetSuite/SAP) is a significant architectural challenge. Traditional two-phase commits often aren't viable across disparate systems.

This isn't just about moving data; it's about maintaining 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 when multiple systems must commit or roll back. A failed update in one system can leave others in an inconsistent state, causing fulfillment delays, inventory discrepancies, or financial reconciliation nightmares. This is particularly complex with hybrid API/EDI interactions where latency varies.

Adopt the 𝗦𝗮𝗴𝗮 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 within your integration layer. Design each step as a local transaction, publishing events that trigger subsequent steps. Crucially, implement 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 for each step. If a step fails downstream, execute these compensating actions to revert previous successful operations and return the entire process to a consistent state. This requires robust event logging and correlation IDs.

How are you handling distributed transactions and cross-system data consistency in your high-scale logistics environments?
