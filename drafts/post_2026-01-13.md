Most WMS-to-ERP integrations fail not because of poor data mapping, but because of 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 in the EDI 856 (ASN) feedback loop. 

Relying on batch EDI processing for advanced ship notices creates a visibility "black hole." When your WMS completes a wave, but the ERP doesn't reflect the inventory reduction for 20-30 minutes, you risk overcommitting stock in your 𝗙𝗠𝗦 or e-commerce front-end. This is where "ghost inventory" kills customer satisfaction and causes backorder chaos.

To solve this synchronization gap:
- Shift critical status updates from scheduled batches to 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀.
- Implement 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 for real-time inventory reconciliation.
- Reserve EDI for high-volume, non-time-sensitive transactional records (like 810 Invoices).
- Ensure your 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆 can handle the burst traffic generated during high-volume warehouse waves.

A hybrid approach provides the structural stability of EDI with the immediate responsiveness of modern web services. Don't let legacy batching intervals dictate your inventory accuracy.

Are you still batch-processing your ASNs, or have you migrated your inventory triggers to a real-time API?
