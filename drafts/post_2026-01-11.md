Stop relying on scheduled API polling for high-velocity inventory updates. It is the fastest way to create synchronization lags that trigger overselling and marketplace penalties.

In a multi-node fulfillment environment, even a five-minute polling interval is an eternity. When the delta between "available to promise" and actual physical stock grows, your 𝗢𝗠𝗦 and 𝗪𝗠𝗦 are essentially flying blind. 

The solution is shifting to an 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 using 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀. Instead of your middleware constantly asking the WMS "what changed?", configure the WMS to push a payload the millisecond a `pick-complete` or `receipt-confirmation` status is triggered. 

If you are moving to this model, ensure your integration layer handles 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗸𝗲𝘆𝘀. Without them, network retries will lead to duplicate stock adjustments, creating a new set of data integrity nightmares. 

Validation is everything. Moving to a "push" model requires a robust error-handling queue to manage failed deliveries, but the reduction in buffer stock requirements makes the transition mandatory for scale.

Are you still managing critical inventory levels via legacy batch EDI 846, or have you migrated to a real-time push model?
